     import { Button, Table } from 'konui-svelte';
   </script>

   <Button label="Click Me!" />
   <Table
     label="User Data"
     value={[{ name: 'John Doe', email: 'john@example.com' }]}

## 🌟 Highlights

### 1. **Form & Table Generation**

Define your form or table layout with JSON, and KonUI generates it for you:

```svelte
<Table
  label="User List"
  value=[
    { name: "Alice", email: "alice@example.com" },
    { name: "Bob", email: "bob@example.com" }
  ]
  group=[
    { name: "name", label: "Name", variant: "text" },
    { name: "email", label: "Email", variant: "email" }
  ]
/>
```

> **Note**: This component is part of an alpha release. Avoid using it in production.

### 2. **Charts**

Effortlessly create charts with minimal configuration:

```svelte
<PieChart
  data=[
    { label: "Apples", value: 40 },
    { label: "Oranges", value: 30 }
  ]
  title="Fruit Distribution"
/>
```

> **Note**: Charts are still in development. We do not recommend using them in production environments at this time.

### 3. **Customizable Buttons & Inputs**

Easily customize button styles and input configurations:

```svelte
<Button label="Save" variant="solid" color="success" />
<Input field={{ name: "email", label: "Email", variant: "email" }} value="user@example.com" />
```
